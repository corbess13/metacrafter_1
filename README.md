# metacrafter_1
This last project will bring together everything you've learned with a little Web3 spice for flavor!

For your project, you will mint NFTs! Ok, not really, but we can pretend, yes? You will simulate this by writing some JavaScript code that will create an object that represents your NFT and that will hold its metadata. This metadata can be anything you want, so go crazy! An example of this could be values like name, eye color, shirt type, bling, etc. Once you have that, you'll need a variable to store all of your NFTs in. Next, you'll need a function so you can print the details of your epic NFTs to the console.

To get you started, we've created some sample code to give you a foundation to begin your project with. Follow these steps, and you'll be at the finish line in no time! Not sure where to begin? Don't worry, you're not alone in this journey because we will be coding this together! That said, I do encourage you to try this on your own first :muscle:
Create a variable that can hold a number of NFT's. What type of variable might this be?
Create an object inside your mintNFT function that will hold the metadata for your NFTs. The metadata values will be passed to the function as parameters. When the NFT is ready, you will store it in the variable you created in step 2
Your listNFTs() function will print all of your NFTs metadata to the console (i.e. console.log("Name: " + someNFT.name))
For good measure, getTotalSupply() should return the number of NFT's you have created
